The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive Java application that demonstrates five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

1) Bubble Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
2) Selection Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
3) Insertion Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
4) Merge Sort: O(n log n) time complexity; O(n) space complexity.
5) Quick Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(n) space complexity.

The application features real-time visualizations of each algorithm's sorting process, enhancing understanding of algorithm efficiency and mechanics.
