The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive Java application that demonstrates five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

Bubble Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
Selection Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
Insertion Sort: O(n²) time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
Merge Sort: O(n log n) time complexity; O(n) space complexity.
Quick Sort: O(n²) average time complexity; O(n) space complexity.
The application features real-time visualizations of each algorithm's sorting process, enhancing understanding of algorithm efficiency and mechanics.
